frequency analysisfrom wikipedia the free encyclopediafor other uses see frequency analysis disambiguationa typical distribution of letters in english language text weak ciphers do not sufficiently mask the distribution and this might be exploited by a cryptanalyst to read the messagein cryptanalysis frequency analysis is the study of the frequency of letters or groups of letters in a ciphertext the method is used as an aid to breaking classical ciphersfrequency analysis is based on the fact that in any given stretch of written language certain letters and combinations of letters occur with varying frequencies moreover there is a characteristic distribution of letters that is roughly the same for almost all samples of that language for instance given a section of english language e t a and o are the most common while z q and x are rare likewise th er on and an are the most common pairs of letters termed bigrams or digraphs and ss ee tt and ff are the most common repeats the nonsense phrase etaoin shrdlu represents the  most frequent letters in typical english language textin some ciphers such properties of the natural language plaintext are preserved in the ciphertext and these patterns have the potential to be exploited in a ciphertextonly attackcontents  hide frequency analysis for simple substitution ciphersan examplehistory and usagefrequency analysis in fictionsee alsofurther readingreferencesexternal linksfrequency analysis for simple substitution ciphersin a simple substitution cipher each letter of the plaintext is replaced with another and any particular letter in the plaintext will always be transformed into the same letter in the ciphertext for instance if all occurrences of the letter e turn into the letter x a ciphertext message containing numerous instances of the letter x would suggest to a cryptanalyst that x represents ethe basic use of frequency analysis is to first count the frequency of ciphertext letters and then associate guessed plaintext letters with them more xs in the ciphertext than anything else suggests that x corresponds to e in the plaintext but this is not certain t and a are also very common in english so x might be either of them also it is unlikely to be a plaintext z or q which are less common thus the cryptanalyst may need to try several combinations of mappings between ciphertext and plaintext lettersmore complex use of statistics can be conceived such as considering counts of pairs of letters bigrams triplets trigrams and so on this is done to provide more information to the cryptanalyst for instance q and u nearly always occur together in that order in english even though q itself is rarean examplesuppose eve has intercepted the cryptogram below and it is known to be encrypted using

mean that initial guesses are incorrect it may be necessary to backtrack incorrect guesses or to analyze the available statistics in much more depth than the somewhat simplified justifications given in the above exampleit is also possible that the plaintext does not exhibit the expected distribution of letter frequencies shorter messages are likely to show more variation it is also possible to construct artificially skewed texts for example entire novels have been written that omit the letter e altogether  a form of literature known as a lipogramhistory and usagefirst page of alkindis th century manuscript on deciphering cryptographic messagesarabic letter frequency distributionthe first known recorded explanation of frequency analysis indeed of any kind of cryptanalysis was given in the th century by alkindi an arab polymath in a manuscript on deciphering cryptographic messages it has been suggested that close textual study of the quran first brought to light that arabic has a characteristic letter frequency its use spread and similar systems were widely used in european states by the time of the renaissance by  cicco simonetta had written a manual on deciphering encryptions of latin and italian text arabic letter frequency and a detailed study of letter and word frequency analysis of the entire book of quran are provided by intellaren articlesseveral schemes were invented by cryptographers to defeat this weakness in simple substitution encryptions these includedhomophonic substitution use of homophones  several alternatives to the most common letters in otherwise monoalphabetic substitution ciphers for example for english both x and y ciphertext might mean plaintext epolyalphabetic substitution that is the use of several alphabets  chosen in assorted more or less devious ways leone alberti seems to have been the first to propose this andpolygraphic substitution schemes where pairs or triplets of plaintext letters are treated as units for substitution rather than single letters for example the playfair cipher invented by charles wheatstone in the midth centurya disadvantage of all these attempts to defeat frequency counting attacks is that it increases complication of both enciphering and deciphering leading to mistakes famously a british foreign secretary is said to have rejected the playfair cipher because even if school boys could cope successfully as wheatstone and playfair had shown our attachs could never learn itthe rotor machines of the first half of the th century for example the enigma machine were essentially immune to straightforward frequency analysis however other kinds of analysis attacks successfully decoded messages from some of those machinesletter frequencies in spanishfrequency analysis requires only a basic understanding of the statistics of the plaintext language and some problem solving skills and if performed by hand tolerance for extensive letter bookkeeping during world war ii wwii both the british and the americans recruited codebreakers by placing crossword puzzles in major newspapers and running contests for who could solve them the fastest several of the ciphers used by the axis powers were breakable using frequency analysis for example some of the consular ciphers used by the japanese mechanical methods of letter counting and statistical analysis generally ibm card type machinery were first used in world war ii possibly by the us armys sis today the hard work of letter counting and analysis has been replaced by computer software which can carry out such analysis in seconds with modern computing power classical ciphers are unlikely to provide any real protection for confidential datafrequency analysis in fictionpart of the cryptogram in the dancing menfrequency analysis has been described in fiction edgar allan poes the goldbug and sir arthur conan doyles sherlock holmes tale the adventure of the dancing men are examples of stories which describe the use of frequency analysis to attack simple substitution ciphers the cipher in the poe story is encrusted with several deception measures but this is more a literary device than anything significant
