<!-- # Project log

Here I will log my notes from my journey through the project. -->

## Day 1: Starting the project... by doing something else.

I started the project after seeing the Emoji tracker website displaying real time data about emoji usage on Twitter. This gave way to this project, made to test the hypothesis that emoji follow Zipf's law.

But I didn't really do anything *directly* aimed at the project. I instead started documenting my intentions first, padded with a bit of an explanation for what's what and what's happening. This in turn gave way to an overly long showcase of Zipf's law through character freqyency analysis and usage of Matplotlib - which finally I had a use of. I wanted to work with it quite badly after being first introduced to it. But learning *yet another Python library* takes time and took me away from actually starting building the project. Oh well...

## Day 2: Nodejs x Twitter themed allnighter

I am currently in Vietnam for unrelated matters and my plane back to France is at 8:30am, which, taking a 2 hour buffer just in case + driving there; I need to wake up at 4am tomorrow.  
Screw this "sleeping" thing, the flight will be a long 13 hours cramped in an Economy class seat and I will have time to sleep there.

Let's start writing some actual JS code!

Or should I say *TS code*, because I'm so fond of scrtict typing that I'm happy to add another compilation step just for it. Plus VS Code is awesome with TS.

I'm building the project with Node v8 and TS v2.5. Nodejs stuff is still new to me so I'm bound to making mistakes.

Wish me luck...
