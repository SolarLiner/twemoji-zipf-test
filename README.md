## Preface
  
  
I've recently came across the Twemoji tracker from a [Vsauce DONG](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1RPFzZN3Ro ) and marvelled at all the real-time, flashing lights of emojis being used all over twitter. But then as I looked at the pattern my subconscious started screaming "ZIPF Law!". That is, indeed, a weird thing to scream; but this is what got me started on this journey. I started wondering about the frequency at which they were used.
  
At the time of writing, the *face with tears or joy emoji* ðŸ˜‚ is the most used emoji on [Emoji tracker](http://emojitracker.com ), and also is the most frequently sent.
  
### The Zipf law?
  
  
> Zipf's law states that given some corpus of natural language utterances, the frequency of any word is inversely proportional to its rank in the frequency table.
  
This quote from the [Wikipedia entry on Zipf's law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law ) describes in more mathematical terms that the most used word in a language will be used twice as often as the second-most used word, and three times as often as the third-most used word, and etc.
  
Let's take the classical visual example: All of Sheakspeare works, counting word occurence.
